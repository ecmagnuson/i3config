# i3config

I have a really old laptop that I wanted to try i3wm on.

The process to setup i3 to not look like crap took forever. It is not something I want to repeat, so this config file should be helpful for that

A lot of this is from 
https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/i3-starterpack

but I just took inspiration from the .config files so I didn't fork
